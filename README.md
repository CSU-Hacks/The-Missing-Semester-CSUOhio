# The-Missing-Semester-CSUOhio

### [Website](https://csuohio.hosting.acm.org/the-missing-semester-of-your-cs-education/)

The Missing Semester Of Your CS Education is inspired by the MIT course of of the [same name](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/). It aims to cover the aspects of a developer's workflow that are often missed in a formal education, yet are vital to a developer workflow. It is a student led effort, presented by the CSUOhio Association of Computing Machinery. 

This course assumes that students have at least a basic working knowledge of programming (at CSU, it is assumed that students have completed at least CIS 151 and 260), and is not aimed at covering basic programming concepts. Most of the code examples will be in Python for simplicty, however the concepts can be applied to almost any workflow using a variety of languages.

All commandline material is written for a Unix environment, specifically a Bash environment. For students with a Windows Machine, they are encouraged to install a WSL environment (using Ubuntu 20.04 as the distro is recommended). For students using a Mac, most of the content will work without issue on their native terminals, but if a linux box is available, this is recommended. 

Using a native Windows commandline is not recommended. DOS terminals and Unix terminals simply do not use much of the same syntax.


## Topics to be covered:

- Unix command line usage and basic bash scripting
- Git/Github and version control
- API usage, and basic API development concepts
- Containerization and Orchestration
- Info assurance and security
    - OWSAP Top Ten
    - SQL Injection
    - Cross Site Scripting
    - Encryption and Hashing
- Devops workflows
- Debugging
- UI/UX Development
- Automation, including bash scripting, python scripting, and low code tools
- Soft skills
